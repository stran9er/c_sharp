# Placeholder for a small pass check program in C#

- The program will:
     - Ask the user for a password to verify.
     - Ask for the list to verified against.
     - Return a message if the password is compromised or not.
     - Ask if another password is to be verified.

     > Additionally, this program will serve as a strong Rnd password generator.
